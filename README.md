# Cloud-Project

This quarter as a part of our Cloud Computing Graduate Level course, we analyzed the following architectures:
* Ananta
* DCTCP
* RDMA 
* Fattree
* Portland
* BCube
* Optical Switching Architecture
* GFS
* Map Reduce
* Big Table
* Hadoop
* Spark
* Chubby
* Spanner
* DynamoDB
* Azure
* Haystack
* Bosen
* B4
* SDN
* Petuum

For this project, I created a python script to create,
ssh into and terminate an instance on AWS to make the 
process of creating instances simpler. I used the boto3 
library in Python library to programatically create the instances.
